The current experiment, contains the transcription from the podcast [Little talk in slow French](https://open.spotify.com/show/04xgaUm233iT1Th8hWGDyN).

- The podcast is bilingual, dialogues in French and small explanation of words or concept in English. 
- The transcriptions were previously obtained using Google speech-to-text API. The previous work includes: Creation of buckets in Google cloud, uploading large audio files into it and connection to API.
- Beta features for transcription of multi-language audio were tested but the API failed on recognizing when the speaker switch from French to English or vice versa.
- The final transcriptions were obtained just from the audio in French.
- Punctuation marks are not generated by the current version. (Further research is needed)
- Annotations text-time are not included but they could be generated.
- The current results, are not perfect but good enough.
- The transcription are analyzed using pre-trained models from `Spacy` for entity recognition and to obtain lists with vocabulary, verbs, nouns, adjective, etc. 
- More advanced NLP techniques can still be applied.
